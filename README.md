[Documentation](https://nwchemex.github.io/Chemist)

Chemist provides chemistry-related data structures. This includes data
structures for chemistry concepts including atoms, molecules, and atomic-orbital
basis sets.

# Features

Chemist was designed as part of the NWChemEx stack, which means the data
structures in Chemist are designed to be both user-friendly and performant.
Despite being part of the NWChemEx stack, Chemist is a fairly modular library
and can easily be leveraged by other electronic structure packages as well. At
present the main features of Chemist are:

- Support of both structure-of-array and array-of-structures usage.
- Ability to avoid copying via "views".
- The ability to independently control how the nuclei, atoms, molecules, and
  overall system are modeled.
- Efficient C++ classes with Python bindings.

# Installation

Chemist ultimately uses CMake for configuring and building. This means that
installation is usually achieved via a variation on:

```.sh
git clone https://github.com/NWChemEx/Chemist
cd Chemist
cmake -H. -Bbuild -D...
cmake --build build --target install
```
More detailed install instructions can be found
[here](https://nwchemex.github.io/Chemist/install.html).
