/** @brief Class describing a density.
 *
 *  In Electronic structure theory we place a lot of emphasis on the
 *  one-Electron density; however, there are many other densities. This class
 *  is templated on the types and number of particles that the density
 *  describes. In turn this allows for this class to model densities involving
 *  an arbitrary number of arbitrary particles.
 *
 *  @note At the moment this class is basically a strong type which wraps a
 *        tensor and an AOs object.
 *
 *  @note If we want to support Particles... != Electron... we will need to add
 *        TMP to work out the basis type.
 *
 *  @tparam Particles The types of the particles described by this density. At
 *                    the moment the types are used purely for strong typing
 *                    purposes. Expected to be unqualified types.
