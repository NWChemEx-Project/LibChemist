Statement of Need
#################

TL;DR Chemist was written to fill a need in the computational chemistry
community for a library which:

- is modular,
- provides abstractions for chemistry concepts,
- decouples chemistry concepts to the extent possible,
- can serve as a :term:`DSL` across *all* of computational chemistry,
- is performant (including data exchange with other formats)
- is user-friendly

TODO: more details.
