Overview of Chemist
###################

Quantum chemistry seeks to predict and explain phenomena from a large number of
domains including (among others): chemistry, physics, biology, chemical
engineering, and materials science. The unifying theme of these seemingly
disparate phenomena is that they are expressed in terms of chemical systems, a
broad umbrella term we use to denote that the systems are descritized into
nuclei and electrons (as opposed to a more fine-grained resolution including
nucleons, or a more coarse-grained resolution lacking individual atoms). The
natural user interface is thus expressed in terms of chemical concepts.

While it is quite natural to express the problem of interest in terms of
chemical concepts, the models used in quantum chemistry are quantum mechanical
in nature. To connect chemistry to physics, we must translate the chemical
concepts (like atoms) into physical concepts (like operators and
wavefunctions). In practice, the predictive power of physics comes from
its relatively straightforward mapping to mathematics, and the predictive power
of modern physics moreover comes from the fact that computers are really good
at doing math.

Long story short, users want to think in terms of chemical concepts, computers
want to do math, so we need to translate. Chemist is envisioned as a providing
the computer representations for the concepts involved in this translation.
