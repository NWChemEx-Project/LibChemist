Designing the Chemistry Sublibrary
##################################

The chemistry sublibrary of Chemist is comprised of classes designed to
represent concepts more familiar to traditional chemists. These concepts
include things like atoms, molecules, chemical bonds, etc. This should be
contrasted with concepts like wavefunctions and operators which are more
familiar to quantum chemists (which we put in the physics sublibrary).
