What is a cap?
**************

When fragmenting large covalently bonded systems it is usually the case that
there exists at least one bond between say atoms :math:`A` and :math:`B`,
such that there is a fragment which contains :math:`A`, but not :math:`B`.
In this case we say that in forming the fragments we have broken the
:math:`A-B` bond. The resulting fragments would be radicals (assuming the
electrons in the bond are split evenly). Treating the fragments as radicals
would lead to substatially different electornic structure, and we instead
usually prefer to instead approximate the severed bond as existing
between :math:`A` and an added monovalent atom (usually hydrogen). The 
monovalent atom (or sometimes group of atoms) is referred to as a "cap".
