.. glossary::

   chemical system
      We use the term "chemical system" to refer to chemistry objects being
      simulated. A chemical system includes the set of atoms and the fields
      the atoms are embedded in.

   fragment
      A distinction applied to a set of nuclei, a molecule, or a
      :term:`chemical system` which establishes that the set of nuclei,
      molecule, or chemical system is a subset of another set of nuclei,
      molecule, or chemical system, respectively.

.. glossary::

   API
      Stands for application programming interface. This is the interface a
      program exposes so that it can be called by other software.

   ONIOM
      Stands for "Our own N-layered Integrated molecular Orbital and Molecular
      mechanics". The ONIOM method is a generalization of :term:`QM/MM`, to an
      arbitrary number of methods.

   QM/MM
      Stands for "Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics". QM/MM is a technique
      where part of a target system is modeled with quantum mechanics and the
      rest is modeled with molecular mechanics.
