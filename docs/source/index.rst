Quantum chemistry seeks to predict and explain phenomena from a large number of
domains including (among others): chemistry, physics, biology, chemical
engineering, and materials science. The unifying theme of most quantum chemistry
techniques is that the system being modeled is described with atomic resolution,
i.e., the model accounts for individual nuclei and electrons. In practice,
quantum chemistry then goes on to define a number of other concepts such as
atoms (the combination of a nucleus with electrons), molecules (a set of
atoms), and chemical systems (a molecule plus its environment). Chemist is
charged with providing robust, performant, abstractions for concepts commonly
encountered in quantum chemistry.
